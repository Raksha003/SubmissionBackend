# Submission Backend Server

This is a backend server built with Express.js and TypeScript. It provides three endpoints:

* `GET /ping`: Returns `{ success: true }`
* `POST /submit`: Saves a new submission to the database
* `GET /read`: Retrieves a submission from the database by index

## Running the Server

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
